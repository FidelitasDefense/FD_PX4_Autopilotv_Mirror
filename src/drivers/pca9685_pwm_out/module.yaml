      PCA9685_SCHD_HZ:
        description:
          short: PWM update rate
          long: |
            Controls the update rate of PWM output.
            Flight Controller will inform those numbers of update events in a second, to PCA9685.
            Higher update rate will consume more I2C bandwidth, which may even lead to worse
            output latency, or completely block I2C bus.

      PCA9685_PWM_FREQ:
        description:
          short: PWM cycle frequency
          long: |
            Controls the PWM frequency at timing perspective.
            This is independent from PWM update frequency, as PCA9685 is capable to output
            without being continuously commanded by FC.
            Higher frequency leads to more accurate pulse width, but some ESCs and
            servos may not support it.
            This parameter should be set to the same value as PWM update rate in most case.
            This parameter MUST NOT exceed upper limit of 400.0, if any output of generic 1000~2000us pulse
            width is desired. Frequency higher than 400 only make sense in duty-cycle mode.
