The main GPS will act as rover and output heading information, whereas the secondary will act as moving base. Modes 1 and 2 require each F9P UART1 to be connected to the Autopilot. In addition, UART2 on the F9P units are connected to each other. Modes 3 and 4 only require UART1 on each F9P connected to the Autopilot or Can Node. UART RX DMA is required. RTK is still possible with this setup.
