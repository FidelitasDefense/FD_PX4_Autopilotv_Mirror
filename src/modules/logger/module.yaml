      SDLOG_ALGORITHM:
        default: 2
        description:
          long: Selects the algorithm used for logfile encryption
          short: Logfile Encryption algorithm
        type: enum
        values:
          0: Disabled
          2: XChaCha20
          3: AES
        volatile: false
      SDLOG_BOOT_BAT:
        default: 0
        description:
          long: When enabled, logging will not start from boot if battery power is not detected (e.g. powered via USB on a test bench). This prevents extraneous flight logs from being created during bench testing. Note that this only applies to log-from-boot modes. This has no effect on arm-based modes.
          short: Battery-only Logging
        type: boolean
        volatile: false
      SDLOG_DIRS_MAX:
        default: 0
        description:
          long: 'If there are more log directories than this value, the system will delete the oldest directories during startup. In addition, the system will delete old logs if there is not enough free space left. The minimum amount is 300 MB. If this is set to 0, old directories will only be removed if the free space falls below the minimum. Note: this does not apply to mission log files.'
          short: Maximum number of log directories to keep
        max: 1000

        reboot_required: true
        type: int32
        volatile: false
      SDLOG_EXCH_KEY:
        default: 1
        description:
          long: If the logfile is encrypted using a symmetric key algorithm, the used encryption key is generated at logging start and stored on the sdcard RSA2048 encrypted using this key.
          short: Logfile Encryption key exchange key

      SDLOG_KEY:
        default: 2
        description:
          long: Selects the key in keystore, used for encrypting the log. When using a symmetric encryption algorithm, the key is generated at logging start and kept stored in this index. For symmetric algorithms, the key is volatile and valid only for the duration of logging. The key is stored in encrypted format on the sdcard alongside the logfile, using an RSA2048 key defined by the SDLOG_EXCHANGE_KEY

      SDLOG_MISSION:
        default: 0
        description:
          long: If enabled, a small additional "mission" log file will be written to the SD card. The log contains just those messages that are useful for tasks like generating flight statistics and geotagging. The different modes can be used to further reduce the logged data (and thus the log file size). For example, choose geotagging mode to only log data required for geotagging. Note that the normal/full log is still created, and contains all the data in the mission log (and more).
          short: Mission Log

      SDLOG_MODE:
        default: 0
        description:
          long: Determines when to start and stop logging. By default, logging is started when arming the system, and stopped when disarming.

        default: 1
        description:
          long: 'This integer bitmask controls the set and rates of logged topics. The default allows for general log analysis while keeping the log file size reasonably small. Enabling multiple sets leads to higher bandwidth requirements and larger log files. Set bits true to enable: 0 : Default set (used for general log analysis) 1 : Full rate estimator (EKF2) replay topics 2 : Topics for thermal calibration (high rate raw IMU and Baro sensor data) 3 : Topics for system identification (high rate actuator control and IMU data) 4 : Full rates for analysis of fast maneuvers (RC, attitude, rates and actuators) 5 : Debugging topics (debug_*.msg topics, for custom code) 6 : Topics for sensor comparison (low rate raw IMU, Baro and Magnetomer data) 7 : Topics for computer vision and collision avoidance 8 : Raw FIFO high-rate IMU (Gyro) 9 : Raw FIFO high-rate IMU (Accel) 10: Logging of mavlink tunnel message (useful for payload communication debugging)'
