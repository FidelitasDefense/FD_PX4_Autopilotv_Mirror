      FLW_TGT_ALT_M:
        default: 0
        description:
          long: Maintain altitude or track target's altitude. When maintaining the altitude, the drone can crash into terrain when the target moves uphill. When tracking the target's altitude, the follow altitude NAV_MIN_FT_HT should be high enough to prevent terrain collisions due to GPS inaccuracies of the target.
          short: Altitude control mode
        type: enum
        values:
          0: '2D Tracking: Maintain constant altitude relative to home and track XY position only'
          1: '2D + Terrain: Mantain constant altitude relative to terrain below and track XY position'
          2: '3D Tracking: Track target''s altitude (be aware that GPS altitude bias usually makes this useless)'
        volatile: false
      FLW_TGT_DST:
        default: 8.0
        description:
          long: The distance in meters to follow the target at
          short: Distance to follow target from
        min: 1.0
        type: float
        unit: m
        volatile: false
      FLW_TGT_FA:
        default: 180.0
        description:
          long: 'Angle to follow the target from. 0.0 Equals straight in front of the target''s course (direction of motion) and the angle increases in clockwise direction, meaning Right-side would be 90.0 degrees while Left-side is -90.0 degrees Note: When the user force sets the angle out of the min/max range, it will be wrapped (e.g. 480 -> 120) in the range to gracefully handle the out of range.'
          short: Follow Angle setting in degrees
        max: 180.0
        min: -180.0
        type: float
        volatile: false
      FLW_TGT_HT:
        default: 8.0
        description:
          long: Following height above the target
          short: Follow target height
        min: 8.0
        type: float
        unit: m
        volatile: false
      FLW_TGT_MAX_VEL:
        decimal: 1
        default: 5.0
        description:
          long: This is the maximum tangential velocity the drone will circle around the target whenever an orbit angle setpoint changes. Higher value means more aggressive follow behavior.
          short: Maximum tangential velocity setting for generating the follow orbit trajectory
        max: 20.0
        min: 0.0
        type: float
        volatile: false
      FLW_TGT_RS:
        decimal: 2
        default: 0.1
        description:
          long: lower values increase the responsiveness to changing position, but also ignore less noise
          short: Responsiveness to target movement in Target Estimator
        max: 1.0
        min: 0.0
        type: float
        volatile: false
