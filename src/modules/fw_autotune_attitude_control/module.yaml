      FW_AT_APPLY:
        default: 2
        description:
          long: After the auto-tuning sequence is completed, a new set of gains is available and can be applied immediately or after landing.
          short: Controls when to apply the new gains
        type: enum
        values:
          0: Do not apply the new gains (logging only)
          1: Apply the new gains after disarm
          2: Apply the new gains in air
        volatile: false
      FW_AT_AXES:
        bit:
          0: roll
          1: pitch
          2: yaw
        default: 3
        description:
          long: 'Defines which axes will be tuned during the auto-tuning sequence Set bits in the following positions to enable: 0 : Roll 1 : Pitch 2 : Yaw'
          short: Tuning axes selection

        min: 1
        type: bitmask

      FW_AT_START:
        default: 0
        description:
          long: 'WARNING: this will inject steps to the rate controller and can be dangerous. Only activate if you know what you are doing, and in a safe environment. Any motion of the remote stick will abord the signal injection and reset this parameter Best is to perform the identification in position or hold mode. Increase the amplitude of the injected signal using FW_AT_SYSID_AMP for more signal/noise ratio'
          short: Start the autotuning sequence
        type: boolean

        default: 1.0
        description:
          long: This parameter scales the signal sent to the rate controller during system identification.
          short: Amplitude of the injected signal
