  - definitions:
      HTE_ACC_GATE:
        decimal: 1
        default: 3.0
        description:
          long: Sets the number of standard deviations used by the innovation consistency test.
          short: Gate size for acceleration fusion
        max: 10.0
        min: 1.0
        type: float
        unit: SD
        volatile: false
      HTE_HT_ERR_INIT:
        decimal: 3
        default: 0.1
        description:
          long: Sets the number of standard deviations used by the innovation consistency test.
          short: 1-sigma initial hover thrust uncertainty
        max: 1.0
        min: 0.0
        type: float
        unit: normalized_thrust
        volatile: false
      HTE_HT_NOISE:
        decimal: 4
        default: 0.0036
        description:
          long: Reduce to make the hover thrust estimate more stable, increase if the real hover thrust is expected to change quickly over time.
          short: Hover thrust process noise
        max: 1.0
        min: 0.0001
        type: float
        unit: normalized_thrust/s
        volatile: false
      HTE_THR_RANGE:
        decimal: 2
        default: 0.2
        description:
          long: Defines the range of the hover thrust estimate around MPC_THR_HOVER. A value of 0.2 with MPC_THR_HOVER at 0.5 results in a range of [0.3, 0.7]. Set to a large value if the vehicle operates in varying physical conditions that affect the required hover thrust strongly (e.g. differently sized payloads).
          short: Max deviation from MPC_THR_HOVER
        max: 0.4
        min: 0.01
        type: float
        unit: normalized_thrust
        volatile: false
      HTE_VXY_THR:
        decimal: 1
        default: 10.0
        description:
          long: Above this speed, the measurement noise is linearly increased to reduce the sensitivity of the estimator from biased measurement. Set to a low value on vehicles with large lifting surfaces.
          short: Horizontal velocity threshold for sensitivity reduction
        max: 20.0
        min: 1.0
        type: float
        unit: m/s
        volatile: false
      HTE_VZ_THR:
        decimal: 1
        default: 2.0
        description:
          long: Above this speed, the measurement noise is linearly increased to reduce the sensitivity of the estimator from biased measurement. Set to a low value on vehicles affected by air drag when climbing or descending.
          short: Vertical velocity threshold for sensitivity reduction
        max: 10.0
        min: 1.0
        type: float
        unit: m/s
        volatile: false
