      MC_PITCHRATE_MAX:
        decimal: 1
        default: 220.0
        description:
          long: Limit for pitch rate in manual and auto modes (except acro). Has effect for large rotations in autonomous mode, to avoid large control output and mixer saturation. This is not only limited by the vehicle's properties, but also by the maximum measurement rate of the gyro.
          short: Max pitch rate
        increment: 5
        max: 1800.0
        min: 0.0
        type: float
        unit: deg/s
        volatile: false
      MC_PITCH_P:
        decimal: 2
        default: 6.5
        description:
          long: Pitch proportional gain, i.e. desired angular speed in rad/s for error 1 rad.
          short: Pitch P gain
        increment: 0.1
        max: 12
        min: 0.0
        type: float
        volatile: false
      MC_ROLLRATE_MAX:
        decimal: 1
        default: 220.0
        description:
          long: Limit for roll rate in manual and auto modes (except acro). Has effect for large rotations in autonomous mode, to avoid large control output and mixer saturation. This is not only limited by the vehicle's properties, but also by the maximum measurement rate of the gyro.
          short: Max roll rate
        increment: 5
        max: 1800.0
        min: 0.0
        type: float
        unit: deg/s
        volatile: false
      MC_ROLL_P:
        decimal: 2
        default: 6.5
        description:
          long: Roll proportional gain, i.e. desired angular speed in rad/s for error 1 rad.
          short: Roll P gain
        increment: 0.1
        max: 12
        min: 0.0
        type: float
        volatile: false
      MC_YAWRATE_MAX:
        decimal: 1
        default: 200.0
        description:
          short: Max yaw rate
        increment: 5
        max: 1800.0
        min: 0.0
        type: float
        unit: deg/s
        volatile: false
      MC_YAW_P:
        decimal: 2
        default: 2.8
        description:
          long: Yaw proportional gain, i.e. desired angular speed in rad/s for error 1 rad.
          short: Yaw P gain
        increment: 0.1
        max: 5
        min: 0.0
        type: float
        volatile: false
      MC_YAW_WEIGHT:
        decimal: 2
        default: 0.4
        description:
          long: A fraction [0,1] deprioritizing yaw compared to roll and pitch in non-linear attitude control. Deprioritizing yaw is necessary because multicopters have much less control authority in yaw compared to the other axes and it makes sense because yaw is not critical for stable hovering or 3D navigation. For yaw control tuning use MC_YAW_P. This ratio has no inpact on the yaw gain.
          short: Yaw weight
        increment: 0.1
        max: 1.0
        min: 0.0

        decimal: 2
        default: 0.0
        description:
          long: Setting this parameter to 0 disables the filter
          short: Manual tilt input filter time constant
        max: 2.0
        min: 0.0
