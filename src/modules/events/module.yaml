    EV_TSK_RC_LOSS:
      default: 0
      description:
        long: Enable/disable event task for RC Loss. When enabled, an alarm tune will
          be played via buzzer or ESCs, if supported. The alarm will sound after a
          disarm, if the vehicle was previously armed and only if the vehicle had
          RC signal at some point. Particularly useful for locating crashed drones
          without a GPS sensor.

          various vehicle status changes. Currently PX4 has not implemented any specific
          status events. -
